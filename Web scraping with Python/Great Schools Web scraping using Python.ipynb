    "## Introduction\n",
    "GreatSchools is the leading nonprofit providing high-quality information that supports parents pursuing a great education for their child, schools striving for excellence, and communities working to diminish inequities in education. The website provides ratings and comparison tools based on student growth, college readiness, equity, and test scores for public schools in the U.S. Of all the school rating sites, GreatSchools is the only one that factors student progress — or growth — into its methodology. This is significant as research has shown growth data to provide a more accurate representation of student progress and school quality. As of July 2017, the GreatSchools database contains information for more than 138,000 public, private, and charter schools in the United States.\n",
